# What's Edge Thoughts?

These are my thoughts and notes about all things, but not limited to, defensive cyber security, threat hunting and digital forensics. Basically I needed a place to dump my brain contents where I come and retrieve it at a later date. 

## Purpose

The goal of this site is simple. Read clever researcher's work, the latest cyber threat intelligence or various documentation give it a go, then document the results. I'm hoping to document various aspects of defensive cyber security such as:

- Using powershell, cmd and bash for investigations.
- How-to perform forensic analysis on memory, disk, filesystem, etc.
- Learning more about windows and linux system internals. 
- See what forensic artifacts TTPs leave behind on a system.
- Guides on how to use various industry tools.

    * Do not expect my notes to be comprehensive.
    * Expect mistakes. I make them! You will too!
    * Consult additional resources if it doesn't work the way you want.
